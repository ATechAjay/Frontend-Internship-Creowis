# Task - 1

## Setup TypeScript:

Install TypeScript and configure tsconfig.json with strict mode enabled.

## Practice Core Types:

Define variables with number, string, boolean, array, and tuple.
Work with union and literal types.

Example: Create a function that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart, where each item is represented as a tuple: [name: string, price: number].

# Real-World Scenario:

Create a program that processes a list of employee records.
Each employee has id, name, age, and optional department.
Write a function to filter employees by age and group them by department.
